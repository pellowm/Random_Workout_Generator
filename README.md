# Random WOD

## Description:
This is a workout management tool.  Users can randomly generate a workout requiring only the equipment that they have on hand.  They then have the option to save this workout for future use.

This project was inspired by the March 2020 pandemic stay home directives as a means for athletes to maintain their fitness outside of the gym.  Athletes can feel confident, whether traveling or staying at home, knowing that they can find a suitable workout no matter what their current situation may be.

## Instructions:
This website is built using MySQL, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It is hosted on the Heroku cloud. Access this website at: http://random-wod.herokuapp.com/

On the home page, use the check boxes to indicate the equipment you have on hand.  Click the Get W.O.D. button to generate a workout.  Supply a unique name in order to save and retrieve it in the future.  

To run this code, the server can be started by running `npm start` in the root directory of the project (with your own supplied database connection).
